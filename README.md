**How will work be divided among team members?**

First we will divide the work load into a few pieces, e.g 4-8
pieces. We will rate each task with a score between 1 and 5. For example, we
divide the lab into 5 smaller tasks with score 1,1,4,5,10. We will then assign
the tasks from there depending on who wants to do what.

(Besides coding, tasks include printing the code and the sheets, etc.)

**What will you do if one or more team members are not doing their share of the work?**

We are aware of the difference in ability among the team
members. While picking the tasks (according to the answer for the above
question), some member can consider take less work. As long as everybody keeps
positive and constant communication with the whole team, changes can be
adopted. However, if a member cannot make the deadline and does not communicate
with the team, a majority vote can be held to determine whether and how much
partial grade the member should receive for the particular lab in progress. For
example, this member may only receive 75% of the grades the team get for this
lab.

(Such decisions must be reported to the instructor in written form. The member
receiving the penalty may switch to another team at the instructor's discretion
after the certain lab is finished.)


**How will you track who is responsible for which tasks and the work progress?**

Using the following table

| Task | Assignee |
|--|--|
| Simulator | Anthony |
| HasWeaponState & DeadState | Mina |
| NoWeaponState & OutOfAmmoState | Doris |
| AIContext | Logan |
| Updates to LifeForm | Seth |
